##The Universal List Project
This was the hardest project in my opinion from CS2401 my second semester at Ohio University. The project requires a doubley linked list and a bidirectional external iterator.

#Setup
1. download all the files
2. build and run all .cc files
3. If you want to create .html file with actual colors. Follow instructions in the project file.
